\section{Differentiated Bertrand Competition}
\emph{Differentiated Bertrand Competition}.
There are two firms $i = 1, 2$ simultaneously choosing prices $p_{i} \in [0,1]$.
The demand of firm $i$ is $(D_{i}(p_{i},p_{-i})= 1-3p_{i} + p_{-i}$ and it has zero production costs.
That is, firm $i$'s payoff is $p_{i}D_{i}(p_{i},p_{-i})$.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]

\item Find the best response function of firm $i$.
\newline

\item Find the set of 1-rationalizable, 2-rationalizable, and 3-rationalizable strategies.
\newline

\item Find the unique PSNE.
\newline

\end{enumerate}

\section{Guessing Game}
Consider the following Guessing Game.
There are $n = 10$ players simultaneously choosing a number in ${1,2,3}$.
The winners are the closest to $\frac{1}{2}$ the average guess (they even split the prize between the winners if there is more than one).
Find the set of rationalizable strategy profiles. Justify your answer.
