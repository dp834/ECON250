\section{WATSON 4.2}
Suppose we have a game where $S_1 = {H,L}$ and $S_2 = {X,Y}$.
If player 1 plays $H$, then her payoff is $z$ regardless of player 2's choice of strategy;
player 1's other payoff numbers are $u_1 (L,X) = 0$ and $u_1 (L,Y) = 10$.
You may choose any payoff number you like for player 2 because we will only be concerned with player 1's payoff.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Draw the normal form of this game.

\item If player 1's belief is $\theta_2 = (\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$, what is player 1's expected payoff of playing $H$?
What is his expected payoff of playing $L$?
For what value of $z$ is player 1 indifferent between playing $H$ and $L$.

\item Suppose $\theta_2 = (\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})$. Find player 1's expected payoff of playing $L$.
\end{enumerate}

\section{WATSON 6.6}
In the game pictured here, is it ever rational for player 1 to select strategy C? Why?

\section{Game Matrix}
Derive the game matrix of the game described in Exercise 4 of Chapter 2.
\begin{center}
\begin{game}{3}{3}
    &    L    &    C    &   R   \\
T   &   3,1   &   0,0   &  4,1  \\
M   &   10,0  &   2,2   &  4,3  \\
B   &   7,6   &   1,2   &  3,1  \\
\end{game}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Find all the strictly dominated (pure) strategies for each player.
\item Find all the weakly dominated (pure) strategies for each player.
\item Does the game have a strictly dominant strategy equilibrium?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Legal Battle}
Two players find themselves in a legal battle over a patent.
The patent is worth 20 for each player, so the winner would receive 20 and the loser 0.
Given the norms of the country they are in, it is common to bribe the judge of a case.
Each player can secretly offer a bribe of 0,9 or 20, and the one whose bribe is largest is awarded the patent.
If both players choose not to bribe, or if the bribes are the same amount, then each has an equal chance of being awarded the patent.
(If a player decides to bribe then he pays the judge regardless of who gets the patent).

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Derive the game matrix.
\item Is the game dominance solvable? If so, find the strategy profile surviving IDSDS.
\end{enumerate}
